Remote configuration file checklist.
====================================

MUST:

    - Device must not be present in http://lirc.sourceforge.net/remotes/

    - All data supplied?

          + Kernel revision (uname -r)

          + irrecord --driver and --device option used.

          + Name of remote device, the thing you hold in your hand.

          + Does remote device has a bundled capture device e. g., a usb
            dongle?

          + For bundled USB capture  devices: usb vendor id, product id and
            device string (using dmesg or lsusb).

          + Type of device controlled (TV, VCR, Audio, DVD, Satellite, Cable,
            PVR, HTPC, ...)

          + Device(s) controlled.

          + Remote layout (ascii art showing symbol for each button).

    - Config file should use proper name symbols from namespace where
      applicable (use generate-lircrc -sc to check status).

    - Files with raw data should if possible be converted using
      irrecord -a

    - The toggle_bit_mask should be non-zero if RC5, RC6 or RCMM is in flags.
      If not try with the default values:
          + 0x800 for RC5 protocol.
          + 0x8000 or 0x10000 for RC6 and RCMM protocol.


SHOULD:

    - Is there any known kernel configuration e. g., blacklisted kernel
      modules or specific kernel drivers?

    - URL with device information.

    - Photo of remote (scale to ~100 kb).

    - Ascii art or a sketch of device showing key symbol for each button.



NOTES:

    Key symbols
    -----------
       + Use key symbols from namespace when there's a reasonable alternative.
       + When using non-standard symbols, do *not* use the KEY_ prefix. A
         symbol prefixed with KEY_ is supposed to be a standard symbol.
       + For mouse clicks use BTN_LEFT, BTN_RIGHT
       + For mouse movements use MOUSE_N, MOUSE_S, MOUSE_NW, MOUSE_SE, etc.
       + KEY_RED..KEY_BLUE is preferred to KEY_A..KEY_D.

    generate-lircrc -sc scans file for "bad" symbols. generate-lircrc -uc can
    update many ad-hoc symbols using heuristics - results must be checked!
