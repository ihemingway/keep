        current:release:age
        http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/manual/html_node/Libtool-versioning.html#Libtool-versioning
- git master branch is committed and pushed
- Update NEWS and doc/html-source/install.html (the Updating stuff).
- Create a new git release branch:
      git checkout -b <version>


Steps for a new release (pre or final)

1) Checkout the release branch.

2) Update NEWS and doc/html-source/install.html (the Updating stuff).

3) Update version number in:
        index.html, README, NEWS, setup.sh, configure.ac
   Possibly update doc/html-source/foot.html (new date).
   Update the news entry in README.

4) Commit, tag and push branch:
        git commit -a -s -m "Update for lirc <version> release"
        git tag -a  lirc-<version> HEAD    # Using version like lirc-0_9_0
        git push --tags origin <release-branch>

5) Create tarball:
        ./autogen.sh
        ./configure --with-driver=all --enable-sandboxed
        make distcheck

6) Merge release branch into the 'release' branch:
       git checkout release
       git merge -X theirs <release branch>
   Check that the tags are present also in the release branch (no rebase
   problems):
       git log --oneline --decorate -25

7) Merge release branch into master:
       git checkout -b tmp <release-branch>
       git rebase master
       git checkout master
       git merge tmp
       git branch -d tmp

8) Get tarballs to Christoph to post at http://lirc.org/software/snapshots/,
   or publish it elsewhere.

9) Announce on the list.

For final release:

1) Upload tarball to sourceforge

2) Back in master, increment <version> in the files in step 3 for the next
   version
